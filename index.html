    <p class = "bio">
      My name is Javier Angeles-Robles and I am a third year CS student at Cal-Poly Pomona.
      A little about me, I am 20 years old with future aspiritions to land a job in 
      web-development or cybersecurity, but of course I am expanding my horizon with 
      different options as there are so many areas that computer science can open. A fun fact 
      is that about a year and a half ago I started getting into cooking/baking and ever since 
      then I have been looking up recipes and trying them out for my family. In fact the two recipes
      shared on this website are two that I make fairly frequently because they've gotten a hit from 
      my family.

  <h1><span style = "color:rgb(14, 81, 148)" class = "border underline">Directions To Make The Cake</span></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Take your cake pan and butter it or spray with baking spray.</li>
      <li>Take a large bowl and whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      <li>
        The eggs will be separated into two different bowls. 1 bowl 
        will be a medium bowl to hold the yolks and another bowl will be a 
        large bowl to hold the whites. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the whites in the large bowl until they are foamy which usually takes 
        1 minute. As you are doing this you will slowly pour in 1/4 cups of sugar 
        and continue beating for roughly another 3 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In the bowl containing the egg yolks, add in the remaining 1 cup of sugar and 
        beat it all together until it is pale and fluffy which is roughly 1 minute.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Still on the medium bowl, add in the whole milk and vanilla extract and whisk 
        it all together, once that is done combine it together with the large bowl that
        has the flour, baking powder, and salt and mix until just combined. 
        WARNING: DO NOT OVERMIX!
      </li>
      <li>
        With this new flour mixture we will now combine it together with the remaining 
        large bowl that holds the egg whites. You will then fold it all together 
        until a soft fluffy batter remains ready to go into the cake pan. 
      </li>
      <li>
          Take the batter and pour into a buttered or sprayed cake pan making sure it is as 
          layered as possible. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes and upon finishing let the cake cool
          in a slightly warm place.
      </li>
    </ol>

        As the cake is cooling down it will seem to be shrinking or falling, but it is important 
        to remember that this is supposed to happen and it is normal no need for any action.

        whole milk until it is well combined.

        Take a fork and poke all the top of the cake 
        and once the top is all poked slowly pour the syrup all over the top then cover 
        and let the cake cool for at least 1 hour.

        Take a large bowl and beat together the heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar until 
        soft peaks form. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Take that mixture and spread all over the cake. Now put the cake into the refrigerator, 
        you may cover the cake if you wish so and add strawberries upon your liking.

        Please note you must leave the cake refrigerated for at least 3 days before you serve it. 
        The tres leches cake tastes best when cold, this time frame allows the best chance for the 
        cake to soak up the syrup for the best result possible.
