      <p>
        The cinnamon sugar should already be made by the time you put the churros into the 
        oil in order to ensure you cover them in this mixture to ensure they stay as 
        warm as possible for when they are served.  
    </details>
    <h1><span style = "color:rgb(14, 81, 148)" class = "border underline">Directions To Make The Cinnamon Sugar</span></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine both the sugar and the cinnammon into one bowl and whisk it together until 
        you get a light brown mixture left. 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1><span style = "color:rgb(14, 81, 148)" class = "border underline">Directions To Make The Churros</span></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take your pot/pan add the water, butter, salt and sugar and bring it all together
        over a medium-high heat temperature on the oven. As it begins to boil take the 
        pan off the heat. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you take out the pot/pan from the heat, add all the flour and stir hard until 
        the flour combines with the burning concoction. This process should last 30
        to 60 seconds. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the pot/pan back to the oven and place over heat again and cook it,
        doing so by stirring for roughly 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon finishing that take the mixture and mix either with an electric or hand mixer. 
        As you are doing this add in the 3 eggs but only add 1 at a time and also add in the 
        vanilla extract. After each egg you add scrape down the sides and mix until the dough
        is smooth and the egg is fully incorporated. DISCLOSURE: To ensure you have a perfect 
        batter check the dough as it should be thick and fall slowly, if the dough is stuck 
        on the beater add an egg until it is fully incorporated for the best batter. 
      </li>
      <li>Take a pot and fill it with vegetable oil and heat it to 370F. </li>
      <li>Take a pastry bag and fit the large star tip then fill the bag with the batter. </li>
      <li>
        Pipe out the batter in roughly 6 inch pieces and place them into the oil, once there 
        leave them for 90 seconds to 2 minutes until they turn a golden brown color. 
        DISCLOSURE: It's best to cut 3, 6 inch pieces of churros at a time as that will allow 
        for the maximum frying conditions leading to a better taste once they are done. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove each churro with tongs and place them on a paper towl for 30 seconds so they 
        have the chance to drain of excess oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once they have been drained, place them in the cinnamon sugar mixture and roll them 
        so all sides of the churro are covered in this mixture. You can then shake each 
        churro to remove excess amounts of sugar. 
      </li>
    </ol>
